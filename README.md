# Greetings and salutations!

This is, supposedly, part 2 of the medical insurance project. 
I am, once again, a medical professional and this time, I am curious about 
how certain factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking 
status contribute to medical insurance costs.

I will apply my newfound knowledge of Python functions to write a useful function that 
calculates medical insurance costs.

### Note --

While insurance companies do use BMI (Body Mass Index) in their calculations, 
and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor 
of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures 
like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.

### Note-Note --

I am using this [medical insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) as a guide, which unfortunately does not include data for non-binary individuals.
