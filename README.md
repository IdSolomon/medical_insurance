# Greetings and salutations!

Supposedly, in this project, I am a medical professional curious about 
how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs.

Using a formula that estimates a person's yearly insurance costs, I will 
investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.

### Note --

While insurance companies do use BMI (Body Mass Index) in their calculations, 
and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor 
of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures 
like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.

### Note-Note --

I am using this [medical insurance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) as a guide, which unfortunately does not include data for non-binary individuals.
